# FL DataTracker

The app allows for the creation of data fields (rows) to store information centralised within forms. The app aims to reduce confusion when communicating the needs of data inputs by standardising the various input types in easy-to-use and adjust form elements.

## Development and Style

The app is written using Jetpack compose for the UI, with data classes to manage in-app state and persistent storage via ObjectBox for quick and efficient information editing. 

## Installation

The installation of the app is simple and can be done by just pulling the repository locally.
